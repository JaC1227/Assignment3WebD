              <img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/HybridTheory.png" alt="Blog Post - Ranking Linkin Park Albums" />
            <div><p>1 - Meteora</p><p>Classic Alt Metal / Nu Metal album. Several hits such as Somewhere I Belong, Numb, Faint, and Breaking the Habit, alongside lesser known but just as awesome tracks like my second favourite Linkin Park song, Don't Stay.</p><p>2 - Hybrid Theory</p><p>In The End, Papercut, Crawling, Points of Authority, One Step Closer... Enough said. Revolutionary album.</p><p>3 - A Thousand Suns</p><p>Linkin Park went straight from from alt metal to electronic rock with A Thousand Suns. It features several awesome tracks such as Blackout, Burning in the Skies, Waiting for The End, and my favourite Linkin Park song, The Catalyst.</p><p>4 - From Zero</p><p>This album literally just came out so it's harder to be objective but I think it's amazing.</p><p>5 - Living Things</p><p>In my opinion this is a heavily underrated album. Lost in The Echo is awesome. I'll Be Gone, Burn it Down, Castle of Glass... Many cool songs on this album and I love the electronic rock sound of this album. It blends the heavy electronic style of A Thousand Suns with their earlier metal stuff.</p><p>6 - Minutes to Midnight</p><p>This is where it gets kind of tough to rank. Minutes to Midnight has some cool songs. Specifically Given Up and What I've Done being the best two tracks on this album. Mostly I prefer heavier stuff so their departure from that heavier sound from their earlier albums kind of put me off on my first listen. Solid album all together though.</p><p>7 - The Hunting Party</p><p>This album to me is basically tied with Minutes to Midnight. They are both equally good. Theres good songs off this album, which is a return to their older nu metal roots, but I don't often listen to stuff off it. I like Until it's Gone and Wastelands. Also Final Masquerade. But nothing on this album is as memorable as their previous albums.</p><p>8 - One More Light</p><p>Title track is good. Otherwise, it's just not my type of music. I can respect that they wanted to try new things though, I think that's admirable. I really do not listen to anything from this album after listening through it for the first time a few years ago, other than occasionally the title track.</p></div>
