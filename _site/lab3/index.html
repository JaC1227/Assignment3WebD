<h2>Serverless Function Providers</h2>
<h3>Netlify</h3>
<p>Netlify excels in simplicity and developer experience, seamlessly integrating with front-end frameworks. It is ideal for small to medium-sized web projects, offering built-in CI/CD and rapid deployment. However, its scalability and feature set are limited compared to larger providers.</p>
<h3>AWS Lamba</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda is highly scalable and versatile, supporting a wide range of programming languages and integrations. With its extensive ecosystem, Lambda is well-suited for large-scale, enterprise-level applications. However, it has a steeper learning curve and potentially higher costs for small-scale use.</p>
<h3>Google</h3>
<p>Google Cloud Functions emphasizes ease of use and excellent integration with Google’s AI and data tools. It is ideal for applications leveraging Google’s ecosystem but may not be as robust as AWS for general-purpose tasks.</p>
<h3>Microsoft</h3>
<p>Microsoft Azure Functions provide deep integration with other Microsoft services, such as Azure DevOps, making it a strong choice for organizations already invested in the Microsoft ecosystem. However, Azure’s documentation and ease of use can lag behind competitors.</p>
<p>I will be using Netlify for its developer-friendly features, rapid deployment, and effectiveness in smaller projects.</p>
<h2>Email Services</h2>
<h3>SendGrid</h3>
<p>SendGrid is well-suited for both transactional and marketing emails. It offers an intuitive platform with robust analytics, detailed categorization of email statistics, and advanced tools for automation and design. SendGrid provides a free tier with 100 emails per day and is ideal for businesses requiring scalable email solutions with marketing campaign tools, such as drip campaigns.</p>
<h3>Mailgun</h3>
<p>Mailgun focuses primarily on developers. It is optimized for transactional emails and offers strong API capabilities for seamless integration. Mailgun also includes inbound email routing and advanced deliverability features but requires a paid plan for access to analytics. Its dashboard is less user-friendly compared to SendGrid’s. Mailgun’s free tier includes 5,000 emails per month for the first three months, making it a good choice for testing and small projects.</p>
<h3>Mailchimp</h3>
<p>Mailchimp is designed for marketing emails, offering user-friendly templates, automation, and segmentation tools. It provides 500 monthly emails on its free plan. Mailchimp is best for small businesses or individuals focusing on newsletters or audience engagement without heavy development needs​</p>
<p>I will be using Mailgun for its more developer focused a free tier email cap more than sufficient for a small assignment. And it was much easier to get an account set up.</p>
